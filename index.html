<p style="font-size: xx-large; color: rgba(27, 27, 34, 0.823);background-color: rgba(232, 240, 240, 0.327);">Known as the City of Lakes, Bhopal is the capital of Madhya Pradesh. Founded by Raja Bhoj, the city has many natural and artificial lakes and it is one of the greenest cities in the country. Bhopal has retained its old world charm despite industrialization, with the old part of the city being full of narrow alleyways and crammed markets, while the new part of the city is better planned and is full of parks and gardens.

  The bhopal city has been a place where Hindus and Muslims have coexisted harmoniously over the years and it is reflected in the cuisine too. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are available here, but Bhopalâ€™s spicy meat delicacies, especially the curries and kebabs, are a result of the Mughal influence. The vegetarian cuisine is mostly mildly spicy and has a distinct taste to it. </p>
